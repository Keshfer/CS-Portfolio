                    <p class ="desc">This is a project from my Web Programming course which I had to make a personal blog website. 
                        The requirements of this project is to use SQLite to hold the data of users, posts, and comments for the server to fetch from and update to based on user interactions.
                        However, to interact with this blog, users register using their Google Account which is handled by Google OAuth.

                    <p class="desc">This project acts as a proof of concept for a type of enemy in a two-dimensional video game.
                        The idea behind the AI is to have an entity move towards the player character while avoiding obstacles and fellow entities.
                        Once close enough, the entity circles the player while still avoiding obstacles and entities.
