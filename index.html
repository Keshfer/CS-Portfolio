                                However, to interact with this blog, users register using their Google Account which is handled by Google OAuth.

                                The game was made by a team of 6, including me, in the Unity game engine. 
                                It takes place on a spaceship being invaded by alien monsters which you must survive 5 minutes of.

                            The idea behind the AI is to have an entity move towards the player character while avoiding obstacles and fellow entities.
                            Once close enough, the entity circles the player while still avoiding obstacles and entities.
