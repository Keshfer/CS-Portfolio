                <h2>ECS 162 - SQLite blog website project using Google OAuth</h2>

                <p>The SQLite blog website is a final project from my ECS 162 Web Programming course. 
                    The main goal of this project is to understand how a website interacts with a server, database, and API. 
                    The secondary goal is to stylize the website in our style.
                    For the main goal, I had to learn how to use Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite, which required learning how to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux to use them. 
                    The secondary goal didn't require as many tools. 
                    I used Figma to create the post and comment boxes that will render with each post and comment made on the blog. 
                    CSS styled everything else.

                    A big part of the blog is being able to show posts and comments from users. 
                    This is implemented by using SQLite as the database and Express.js as the framework that commands the collection and modification of data in the database. 
                    Each time the post page is refreshed, the server fetches posts stored in the database and displays them. 
                    For making posts, there is a section to create a post as seen on the left section of the picture. 
                    Upon sending a post, the server writes the post's data into the database, and refreshes the page. 
                    This causes the server to fetch the posts list but with the new post included.

                    To do anything on this blog, one must make an account first. 
                    Account creation is handled with Google OAuth which a user registers an account with the server using their Google account. 
                    The server collects Google OAuth's response either to prompt the user to register a username with the blog or simply sign the user into their existing account based on the data stored in the database. 
                    For a layer of security, I used Bcrypt to encrypt the user's Google ID to make such sensitive information much more difficult to access in a leak.

                    An additional feature of the blog is the ability to add emojis to posts. 
                    This is done through the Open Emoji API by fetching the list of emojis from the API and displaying the first 200 emojis. 
                    I've also included a search bar to filter for other emojis the API provides. 
                    The search bar refreshes the resulting emojis with each change made to the search term, removing the need to press a button to signal to the blog to start filtering for emojis.
