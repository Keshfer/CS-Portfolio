                <h2>ECS 162 - SQLite blog website project using Google OAuth</h2>

                <p>The SQLite blog website is a final project from my ECS 162 Web Programming course. 
                    The main goal of this project is understand how a website interacts with a with a server, database, and API.
                    The secondary goal is the stylize the website in our own style. 
                    For the main goal, I had to learn how to use NodeJs, ExpressJs, and SQLite, which required learning to setup Windows Subsystem for Linux in order to use those softwares.
                    The secondary goal didn't require as many tools. I used Figma to conveniently create the post and comment boxes that will render with each post and comment made on the blog. CSS was used to for styling everything else.

                    A big part of the blog is being able to show posts and comments from users. 
                    This is implemented by using SQLite as the database and ExpressJs as the framework that commands the collection and modification of data in the database.
                    Each time the post page is refreshed, the server fetches the posts stored in database and displays them in the page.
                    
                    For making posts, there is a section to create a post on the left side of the screen. Upon sending a post, the server writes the post's data into the database, and refreshes the page.
                    This causes the server to fetch the posts list but with the new post included.

                    To do anything on this blog, one must make an account first. 
                    Account creation is handled with Google OAuth which a user registers an account with the server using their Google account.
                    The server collects Google OAuth's response either to prompt the user to register a username or simply sign the user into their existing account based on the data stored in the database.
                    For a layer of security, I used bcrypt to encrypt the user's google ID to make such sensitive information much more difficult to access in a leak.

                    An additional feature of the blog is the ability to add emojis to posts. This is done through the Open Emoji API by fetching the list of emojis 
                    from the API and displaying the first 200 emojis. I've also included a search bar to filter for the other emojis
                    the API provides. The search bar refreshes the resulting emojis with each change made to the search term, removing the need to press a button to signal to the blog to start filtering for emojis.
